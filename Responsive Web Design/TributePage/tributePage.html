      <h1>Early Life</h1>
      <p>Jackie Chan, originally Chan Kong-sang, (born April 7, 1954, Hong Kong), Hong Kong-born Chinese stuntman, actor, and director whose perilous acrobatic stunts and engaging 
        physical humour made him an action-film star in Asia and helped to bring kung fu movies into the mainstream of American cinema.</p>
      <p>Chan was born to impoverished parents in Hong Kong. The family moved to Canberra, Australia, when Chan was six, but the following year his parents sent him back to 
        Hong Kong to attend a strict boarding school that trained students for jingxi. From age 7 to 17 he studied acrobatics, singing, martial arts, and mime—skills that launched 
        him into a position with a professional tumbling troupe and landed him bit roles as a child actor and, later, as a stuntman.</p>
      <p>The independent film producer Lo Wei, hoping to find a successor to the late Bruce Lee, cast him in a series of lacklustre kung fu movies in 1976–78. Rather than ape Lee’s 
        gritty persona, in 1978 Chan utilized his own form of bumbling physical comedy in his first successful films, She xing diao shou (Snake in the Eagle’s Shadow) and Zui quan (Drunken Master). 
        He then wrote and directed as well as starred in Xiao quan guai zhao (1979; The Fearless Hyena).</p>
